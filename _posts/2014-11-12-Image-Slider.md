### jQuery: Image Slider Fun

This week we have begun to dive into jQuery and all of its glory and have had
several mini projects. Our first big project with jQuery was to build an interactive
full-width image slider. This project brought up a lot of challenges but the
finished product was excellent. It was a lot of fun to see it all come together
in the end. I am going to incorporate this slider into my blog layout with displaying
my projects on a slide. So look out for that in the near future.

Have an excellent day

## Day 3..2.1 Go!

##### 9/24/14

From customizing our blog theme and layout to going back through the major
git commands and re-designing the blog from scratch. The re-design is the
beginning of developing our own [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) for our
Iron Yard Blog.


We also had a great morning with our usual group Stand Up session. David lead
us through the 3 important questions to keep us on track for our goals as a class.
We also got to surprise David as a class thanks to Sarah's planning to incorporate
our own lovely rendition of Happy Birthday into the Stand Up session for him. The
entire class was excited to wish him a very Happy Birthday and to enjoy the
birthday donuts and coffee in the morning and then some delicious cake after
lunch.


After the excitement we all got back to work on our re-designs and completing
our initial layouts. Working together is becoming a regular thing for everyone
which is excellent. There are so many students either stepping up and offering
to help when they feel strong at a certain subject matter. Other students
who know that they need a little help are asking for help and we are all looking
each other to continue along this journey.


Next up is the full re-design of the blog, lets see how this goes

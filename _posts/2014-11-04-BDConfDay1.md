### Everything You’re Doing is Wrong!
Today we got to attend the [Breaking Development](https://bdconf.com/) Conference 2014.
Got to listen to speakers:

  * [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/)

  * [Jenn Lukas](http://jennlukas.com/)

  * [John Saddington](http://john.do/)

  * [Jason Grigsby](https://twitter.com/grigs)

  * [Hampton Catlin](http://www.hamptoncatlin.com/)

  * [Aaron Gustafson](http://aaron-gustafson.com/)

  * [Jason VanLue](http://jasonvanlue.com/).



All of the talks were excellent and really provided some amazing insights into
the mobile first, progressive enhancements, and responsive web design philosophies.
I am definitely looking forward to Day 2 with even more Responsive and Mobile talks.
If your site isn’t mobile friendly then you are missing out on an enormous amount
of users. And most of all I learned that everything I am doing, you are doing, we
are doing as Web Developers is __WRONG__(kind of). It may work for the time and specs
right now but it will be technically “wrong” somewhere in the near future.

Now it is time to work on the redesign of this blog structure and style and on
our latest project for the surf shop layout.


Welcome to being wrong!

#### Logan Out!

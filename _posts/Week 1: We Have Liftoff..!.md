# We Have Liftoff at The Iron Yard Orlando!

 Week 1 of learning Front End Engineering at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) Academy in [Orlando](http://theironyard.com/locations/orlando/) 
 is underway. We have begun with the *ins* and *outs* of [Github](https://github.com/)
 as a project management tool and the overall value of Git. We are continuing to
 expand on our knowledge of useful workflow tools by adding [BaseCamp](https://basecamp.com/) and [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/)
 to our repertoire. We are going through all of these sites/apps in great detail 
 to really discover their true potential of assisting us in our student projects
 but most importantly in our professional lives post Iron Yard.

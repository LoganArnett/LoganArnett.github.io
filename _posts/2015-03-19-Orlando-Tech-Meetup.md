### Orlando Tech Meetup

Tonight I went out to the monthly [Orlando Tech Association](http://orlandotech.org/) meetup. 
There were five different startup companies pitching their concepts and products which
were some pretty cool web and mobile apps.  All of the pitches were from startups that
are either currently going through or have completed [Starter Studio](http://starterstudio.com/), a program
that offers startup companies an excellent mentorship program and offers a large variety of resources
to get your ideas off the ground. 

The presenting companies were [Fatt Merchant](https://fattmerchant.com/), [Rapido](http://gorapido.co), [Auto Retainer](http://autoretainer.com), 
[Fit Bot](http://thefitbot.com), and [JoiCaster](http://joicaster.co)(The Starter Studio Alum). You can click the links
above to find out more about what these startups have to offer. Some of them have an established
product while others are still in a demo/beta phase in order to solidify their overall products/services.

The meetup was hosted by and held at the new [Effin Amazing](http://effinamazing.com/) coworking space, the newest 
coworking space in Orlando. The space was excellent and the food trucks at the event were an excellent
way for everyone to mingle and network while chowing down on some delicious eats. I

I have only recently begun going regularly to a few of the more interesting meetups in Orlando and I definitely
recommend it to anyone interested in the Orlando Tech scene or any tech scene for that matter.

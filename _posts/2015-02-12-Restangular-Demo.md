title: Restangular Demo
posted: Feb. 28, 2015
excerpt: Finally got my app past the login screen natively on my phone in development mode so I can fiddle with the features within the mobile environment. I still definitely have some styling to adjust within the app and smooth out some of the transitions between screens but overall this project has been an awesome undertaking.

### Restangular Demo

Today I was given the opportunity to discuss some AJAX calls using [AngularJS(https://angularjs.org/). The students
are fairly new to the overall Angular framework and are beginning to need to access info
from some different API's to create the projects they are looking forward to this weekend.

I began by briefly covering the $http service that comes with AngularJS and is very capable
of allowing the access to the API and the information they are requesting. But today was
more about the process of the GET and POST requests and to introduce them to the amazing
tool known as [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular).

Restangular is an excellent AngularJS service that minimizes client side code for all types
of requests. It also allows the user to customize the request down to a very specific level.
I went through a live code example of accessing the Etsy API and bringing in the trending
items into a basic store wireframe that I constructed. The students had been working on cUrl
this data from the API and storing it into a JSON file. Then cUrling the date again each day
to update the trending products. After I showed them Restangular and how easy it is to use,
we were pulling data directly out of the API in real time.

Watching the students react to the successful GET requests and seeing the new data populate
their store mock ups was very rewarding. This experience as a Teaching Assistant has definitely
opened my mind up to new ideas and a great new way for myself to learn concepts further through
teaching them to others.

So, if you haven't used Restangular in your Angular web apps yet I would definitely recommend
checking it out and seeing how it can help you make API's that much easier to work with and
if you have any questions regarding the use of this tool please let me know and I would love
to help you out.

## The Blog Has Landed

##### 9/23/14

Jumping right in today, Day 2, and going through Git commands and Git Branching.
Also, diving deeper into the usage of [Github](https://github.com/) and [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We have all begun to develop our personal
blog and designed it through the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and themes and
hosted it through Github Pages.

Working through the git commands and pushes and pulls to and from Github through
our online resource Cloud 9 has been demanding. The assignments becoming more
difficult have created a strong team environment both in the classroom but
also outside of the class through our HipChat interface. I believe
developing this collaborative spirit early on in the program will benefit all
of us down the road.

We also go the pleasure of meeting a representative from a local game development
company, [The Indie Box](https://theindiebox.com/), and heard all about what they
do and who they develop for. Their outlook on their target market is very unique
with bringing the retro style games back and sending them directly to their
doorsteps. This introduction has definitely given several of my classmates ideas
on what they may want to do post-graduation. There are a few video game enthusiasts
who would definitely enjoy making a living gaming and sharing that experience
with the world. I wonder who we will all get to meet up with next?

Have a wonderful day everyone!!!

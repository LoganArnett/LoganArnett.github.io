# Day 2: Git Branching, Github Pages, and Jekyll

Today we continued to work on the Git Branching exercises. Rebase, Cherry-Pick, 
and much more with multiple levels and challenges through a Github tutorial. We 
also worked towards developing our personal blog sites through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Combining these two we can create a general 
homepage very quickly and continue to work with the git and command line to push
and pull resources to Github and back to our online workspace in [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/).
Working with these online tools is very quick but it also brings up the idea of 
saving or committing as often as possible in order to ensure you keep your work.
It also prompted several questions about the alternatives to online resources
for any time that they fail and you are forced to work locally.

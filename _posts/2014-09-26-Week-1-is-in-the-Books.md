## Week 1 is in the Books

As my first week at The Iron Yard comes to a close I am amazed at the amount
of knowledge I have consumed in these first few days. I have gone from almost
zero experience in git and github to understanding and utilizing both with ease.
These tools are extraordinarily useful and have expanded my view on the 
possibilities in Front End Engineering. 

I will be continuing the rebuild and customization of my blog over the course of
the weekend and look forward to next week. I am hoping to expand on my HTML and 
CSS knowledge next week and to begin studying Javascript and all of the new
features that I will be able to add to my web pages and applications.

Have a great weekend!

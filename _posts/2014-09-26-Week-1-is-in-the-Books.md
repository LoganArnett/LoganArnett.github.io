## Week 1 is in the Books

##### 9/26/14

As my first week at [The Iron Yard](theironyard.com) comes to a close I am amazed at the amount
of knowledge I have consumed in these first few days. I have gone from almost
zero experience in git and [github](https://github.com/) to understanding and utilizing both with ease.
These tools are extraordinarily useful and have expanded my view on the
possibilities in Front End Engineering.

Throughout this week we were lucky enough to meet a few elite members of the
Orlando Tech community. We had a guest speaker, [Olivier Lacan](http://olivierlacan.com/), from [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/)
on Friday and went through their git and github use as a major online learning
platform. Olivier really painted a strong picture of how much of the git that we
learned is actually utilized in the real world.

I will be continuing the rebuild and customization of my blog over the course of
the weekend and look forward to next week. I am hoping to expand on my HTML and
CSS knowledge next week and to begin studying Javascript and all of the new
features that I will be able to add to my web pages and applications.

Have a great weekend!

#### Logan Out!

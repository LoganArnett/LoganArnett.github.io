## First Big Project

Today we have turned in our rebuild of our original blog with just the bare
bones of code to ensure our strength in the use of the major git commands.
After rebuilding a 2nd time and continuing to customize our themes we have been
assigned our first big project for the weekend. This project will be a complete
rebuild of our blog all the wa back from our inital commit from our first steps 
of setting up our github pages. 

Over the next few days I will begin to rebuild my blog and hope to customize it
with some of the HTML and CSS that I know from before entering The Iron Yard 
program. This page will continue to update throughout the next few weeks as we 
continue to advance through different coding languages. I hope that you enjoy
the final product.

### Logan Out!

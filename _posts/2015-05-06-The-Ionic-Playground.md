### The Ionic Playground

I have refactored a few of my Angular web apps in the Ionic Framework and found it to be a
very interesting way of developing hybrid apps. I recently started developing Ionic Apps starting
with no Angular wireframing at all and there are a lot of tools and tricks that Ionic offers to allow
you to use all your front-end knowledge to develop complex and unique mobile apps. 

Well today on Ionics blog they unveiled a new tool that they have developed for quick mockups 
and some basic demos. The [Ionic Playground](http://blog.ionic.io/the-ionic-playground/) allows
to code directly in the browser and then see the result on the iPhone demo screen on the right side
of the screen in real time. 

So if you are just starting out with Ionic or Angular or are an expert in both, you can check out the 
Ionic Playground and have some fun. See how complex you can get in the build out of your app. 
Then once you reach a point where you think you have a good starting point just bring it over into 
your project. Hope you guys enjoy.

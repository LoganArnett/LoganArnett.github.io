excerpt: They are now able to update their Google Calendar with event times, details, and address, so their fans can click on a date and be taken directly to the Google Maps for the venue.

### Building a Band site with HTML5, CSS3, and some AngularJS

Got a new project building out a page for a buddy of mines band, [Wild English](https://soundcloud.com/wildenglish/), out in Seattle.
Working with the [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) and the [Google Calendars](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/) to bring in their music and event dates.

## Blogging with [@Saddington](https://twitter.com/saddington)

##### 10/8/14

Today we were visited by [John Saddington](http://john.do/) from [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) to
discuss how blogging can be effective in developing our own personal brand.
So as I am writing this blog post I am learning all of the aspects that I am
missing to actually create meaningful content. Hopefully my posts will improve
from here on out.

We have also begun delving into [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/) for testing out our Node.js scripts.
These tools provide a much cleaner testing interface and really make life a lot
easier. We have also been looking into new tools for how we use arrays in our code
and going back through our projects from last week to refactor and simplify everything.

Next week will be even more `javascript` and some introductions to HTML and CSS
where I will be a little bit more in my comfort zone.

For now Happy Hump Day!!!

### Logan Out!

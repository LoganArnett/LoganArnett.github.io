description: At [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) Academy in the inaugural class at the [Orlando,FL](http://theironyard.com/locations/orlando/) location. In the Front End Engineering program we are going to learn and evolve as web developers through HTML, CSS, and most of all Javascript. So far we have begun with extremely useful Project Management  practices through the use of [Github](https://github.com/) and other tools. Some examples include [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/), and [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/). Today we have begun to delve into the command line tools and learning the basic git commands and git branching. I am looking forward to the evolution of this program from git, github, and learning markdown all the way to building fully functional and interactive websites.

### Atomic Design and Z-Axis Craziness
Day 2 here at the [Breaking Development](https://bdconf.com/) Conference 2014.
Speakers today include:
  * [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/)
  * [Sara Wachter-Boettcher](http://www.sarawb.com/)
  * [Wren Lanier](http://wrenlanier.com/)
  * [Jonathan Stark](https://jonathanstark.com/)
  * [Ben Callahan](http://bencallahan.com/)
  * [Josh Clark](http://globalmoxie.com/about/index.shtml)

Started off the day with some Atomic Design philosophy and apps from Brad.
Checked out the demo of [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) and want to play
with that more to create my own style guide.

Got some great insight from Wren on some extensive uses for the Z-axis/index
within your design. She also mentioned that Apple appears to be utilizing the
z-axis very heavily for the upcoming [Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/watch/).

The last speaker, [Josh Clark](https://twitter.com/globalmoxie), spoke about the
__Internet of Things__ and really opened my eyes to an enormous amount of possibilities
for future development. Now my mind is stuck on the responsive design tools this
conference has opened to me and the future of web development.

What will you develop for the future?

### UI Router Demo

Today I did a demo for the [The Iron Yard Orlando](http://theironyard.com/locations/orlando/) Front End Engineering
students that covered using [UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) in an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) web app.

I went through the concepts of the nested views(which are an awesome feature that NgRoute does not have built in) and $stateParams. The $stateParams are very useful for the students right now as they aim to complete their final projects which for the most part utilize [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as a backend. The $stateParams allow the students to traverse their
Firebase data quickly and easily by customizing the state url for every record that is found at the designated Firebase reference. 
Working with them to learn all of these pieces has been a lot of fun especially with the official 1.0.0 release of [AngularFire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/index.html)
to change things up a little from when I began learning AngularFire only a few months ago.

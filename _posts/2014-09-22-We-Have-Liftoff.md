## We Have Liftoff...!

##### 9/22/14

At [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) Academy in the
inaugural class at the [Orlando,FL](http://theironyard.com/locations/orlando/)
location. In the Front End Engineering program we are going
to learn and evolve as web developers through HTML,
CSS, and most of all Javascript.



So far we have begun with extremely useful Project Management practices
through the use of [Github](https://github.com/) and other tools. Some examples
include [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/),
and [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/). Today we have begun to delve into the command
line tools and learning the basic git commands and git branching. I am looking
forward to the evolution of this program from git, github, and learning markdown
all the way to building fully functional and interactive websites.



The first day was full of exciting introductions to fellow classmates and
colleagues. Going around the room both at the class dinner on Sunday and the
beginning of class was a wonderful experience and offered an insight into
the true diversity of our class.


I look forward to the week to come and all that lies ahead in the coming weeks.


#### Logan Out!

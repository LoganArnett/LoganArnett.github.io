## Getting My Hands Dirty with Node.js

##### 10/2/14

This week has been all `javascript` all the time. We have been focusing heavily
on Node.js and working through 'Strings', Numbers, Arrays[], Functions, and a lot
more. Most of our problems have been geared towards TDD(Test Driven Development),
which has proven to be a very helpful tool not just in the classroom but with
real world application as well.

Problems this week have included a 'String' Calculator, a Check Writing program,
and a basic version of Conways Game of Life. All three of these problems have
a struggle to work through but have added critical thinking to our overall
understanding of the `javascript` syntax. Really working to apply this new
language has been tough for several members of the class as we continue to
strive for a relative fluency base.

Next week we are looking deeper into Node.js and some more tools to help with
our testing, but for now have a great weekend!

#### Logan Out!

### Perch CMS Review

I was recently approached for a freelance opportunity to build a brand new CMS site and the 
client wanted Wordpress. I have dealt with Wordpress in the past and have not enjoyed it to 
much. So I went back to a CMS that I had fiddled with a while back but never really built anything
with called [Perch](http://grabaperch.com/). And it is pretty awesome!

The flexibility available with Perch is phenomenal. I am able to develop my fully customized and
responsive layout or take an existing template/theme and make it a Perch site very quickly and 
efficiently. Every option is customizable and it allows you to leave so many hints and tips as well
as visual cues to the client that will be interacting with the CMS Admin side. 

So all in all Perch has been an excellent way to make a much more customized experience for my
clients and allows for a lot of flexibility.

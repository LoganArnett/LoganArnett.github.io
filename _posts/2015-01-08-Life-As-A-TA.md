### Beginning Life as An Iron Yard Teaching Assistant

This is my first week as the Spring 2015 Front End Engineering Teaching Assistant
at [The Iron Yard Orlando(http://theironyard.com/locations/orlando/)].Watching the students have almost
the exact same reactions and questions to Git and Github is very interesting
and watching them begin to understand and being able to help them through the
learning process is very rewarding. The class is full of great and enthusiastic
student and I am definitely looking forward to seeing what they develop throughout
this course and for their final projects in 12 weeks.

I am also working on some Freelance projects, building a new web site for my buddy
in Seattle and his band has been a lot of fun. Had to incorporate some API's that
I have not had too much experience with yet so that was a great learning moment for
myself getting those to work successfully. I am also looking to take on some more
projects throughout the semester with some of the local Orlando Startups.

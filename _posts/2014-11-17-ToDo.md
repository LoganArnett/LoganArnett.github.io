### MVC ToDo List Application

This weekend was filled with the team project of building a ToDo List Application
entirely in jQuery. The application is able to add tasks, edit tasks, delete tasks,
check off tasks, as well as display their current status in relation to the overall
list. It was a great group project working with all of the different moving pieces
and trying to manage all of the different team members and their progress.

You can find a demo of the [ToDo App here](http://loganarnett.com/TIY-Assignments/MVCtoDo/index.html).

Have a wonderful day

excerpt: I also attended a pretty thought provoking talk about CSS and Javascript animations on the front end and when to use them and when they just get obnoxious. The two presenters for this talk were UX/UI designers so it was a really interesting perspective on the animations and how they can be used to improve the usability and overall user experience when done right.

### Barcamp Orlando 2015

Today was [Barcamp Orlando 2015](http://barcamporlando.org/) and it was an awesome event. Any one from anywhere(mostly Orlando)
could come in and sign up for a time slot to talk about anything they wanted. Some people chose to
add value to other peoples careers through their talks and others chose to simply rant about whatever
they wanted to. No matter what it was all of the talks were interesting and intriguing in their own ways.

With titles from 3D BioPrinting to "Is Mark Zuckerberg A Smug Douchebag?" you know that you were going
to see a fairly wide variety of talks. 

I was able to catch a few of the most interesting talks at least to me. I went to a talk about developing 
hybrid applications using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) framework. 
Ionic is a really cool framework that allows you to take you Angular Web App and compile it into a native
iOS or/and Android Mobile App. The speaker went through a lot of the basics of what your are able to do
and I did not necessarily learn much but I did meet another Ionic app dev which was pretty cool and got to
talk to the presenter more during some of the breaks between talks.

I also attended a pretty thought provoking talk about CSS and Javascript animations on the front end
and when to use them and when they just get obnoxious. The two presenters for this talk were UX/UI
designers so it was a really interesting perspective on the animations and how they can be used to
improve the usability and overall user experience when done right but how they can also destroy your
site or app when used for evil. The displayed a few examples of excellent animations utilized by some 
major companies and startups on their sites. [Fuelly](http://www.fuelly.com/) was the coolest example. 
A web app used to help calculate your vehicles average fuel economy. The homepage features a little
car on the right side and as soon as you scroll down for the first time in any amount the car races down the
page leaving a little trail for you to follow. This animation makes you want to go down the page to find
where the car ended up and makes you view the content of the page as well. It creates an excellent
user experience and is subtle but fun. 

I also threw my hat into the ring and gave a talk of my own about [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), a great tool
for front end developers to have a backend/API to call back to and store data. It is also a quick setup
so it is a great tool for mockups and demos to get ideas for apps off the ground while storing real-time
data. I also discussed one of the additional libraries that Firebase offers called [AngularFire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/) which is 
of course utilized with AngularJS. The talk went very well with a lot of people very interested in the 
capabilities of Firebase. With a live coding demo of the power of Firebase they realized very quickly
that this is a tool they need to explore further.

So after my first Barcamp Orlando and first Barcamp Orlando presentation, I would say the event was 
a huge success and a lot of fun. I can't wait for next time, maybe I will actually prepare a presentation
this time and look a little more official

####Logan Out!

## HTML and CSS Layouts

##### 10/27/14

This weekend was all HTML and CSS. It was also our first attempt at using
Javascript in the browser. We had several `onclick` features for our dropdown
menu and accordion style display page. The Timeline page was mostly design
oriented and gave us a few CSS tricks to add to our toolkit. Using the
Font-Awesome characters was also a lot of fun.


Have a wonderful day and here is a screen shot of the end result of the
vertical timeline layout.

#### Logan Out!

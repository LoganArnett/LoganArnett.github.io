### Building an AngularJS Comments App

Today we have begun the process of building an AngularJS Comments App to add to
our blog. Our basic framework will appear similar to tweeting on Twitter as that
is what we have wire-framed off of. We have also been introduced to some new tools
like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) that help to streamline the production process
of our web applications and pages. Both of these help to tie in our previous
experiences with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to help to build a quickly framed
layout that we can then build off of.

I definitely recommend checking out those resources if you haven't already. Have
a wonderful day.

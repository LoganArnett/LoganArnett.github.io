### AutoJekyll + LinkedIn

I sat down today and decided that it would be fun to look at integrating the [LinkedIn Javascript 
SDK](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/js-sdk) into the [Autojekyll](https://github.com/LoganArnett/AutoJekyll) web application. I wanted to be able to provide a simple interface to be 
able to instantly share the last blog post on LinkedIn as soon as you complete the post.

I looked into the SDK and had a lot of fun setting it up within the AngularJS app. Now I am able
to blog and share it with the world of LinkedIn much quicker and easier. 

I will be putting together some documentation on the Autojekyll implementation process and that 
will include the LinkedIn integration and hopefully Twitter as well.

### The Godfather of Javascript: Brendan Eich

The Orlando Tech Week 2015 Meetup was tonight and it was an awesome event. There were 
some great demos from some awesome startups based out of Orlando. The demos included
[Carespotter](http://carespotter.com), [GolfNow](http://golfnow.com), [ViewPost](http://viewpost.com), and [BookThatDoc](http://bookthatdoc.com).
But the demos were overshadowed slightly by the keynote for the event, the original creator of 
programming language Javascript: Brendan Eich.

Eich was founder and long-term CTO at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/). He also served as SVP of Engineering 
and briefly as CEO. He is widely recognized for his enduring contributions to the Internet 
revolution. In 1995, Eich invented JavaScript (ECMAScript), the Internet’s most widely used 
programming language. The first version of which was completed in just 10 days! He co-founded 
the mozilla.org project in 1998, serving as chief architect, and has been a board member of the 
Mozilla Foundation since its inception in 2003. Brendan helped launch the award-winning [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/) 
Web browser in November 2004.

Eich gave a phenomenal talk, giving us a brief history of Javascript and how it has developed over the years
as a premier programming language. He also discussed the ECMAScript standards and how they
have also evolved over the years and discussed some of the new things to be on the look out for
in the next release of standards.

Overall the event was an excellent experience for anyone not just Javascript developers but it was
especially awesome to be able to listen to the Godfather of Javascript himself. Eich also stayed after
his talk to listen to all of the demoing companies and even offered up some questions and advice for
a few of the presenters on their companies.

Well thats it for me today, keep on javascripting out there

####Logan Out!

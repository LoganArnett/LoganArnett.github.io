The application utilizes the Google Calendar API for the event listings and keeping them up to date. Also makes it nice and easy for the band members themselves to keep that updated at any time from anywhere. The application also pulls from the Soundcloud API to grab the bands profile and playlists for the end user to be able to listen directly on the site.",
